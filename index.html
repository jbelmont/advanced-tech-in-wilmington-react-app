          <h4>Development environment starts with the command npm run dev</h4>
          <p>This npm script executes a gulp task that does a series of actions like linting, copying files and set watchers</p>
          <p>It wraps server in nodemon process so that changes are automatically picked up by the server.</p>
          <p>Webpack is also monitoring changes on the front end and will hot reload code changes</p>

            <h5>This API for the FrontEnd and BackEnd was driven by Test-Driven Development (TDD)</h5>
            <p>I am using several testing libraries avajs, jest, testdouble, supertest, and nock</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/" target="_blank">Jest</a>
            <p>Jest is a newer testing library created by facebook that has nice integration with React although it could be used outside of react.</p>
            <p>Jest has this concept of snapshot testing.</p>
            <p>I added both snapshot tests and traditional unit tests for the action creators and reducers.</p>

            <a href="https://testanything.org/" target="_blank">TAP</a>
            <h6>Avajs is based on the Test Anything Specification (TAP)</h6>
            <p>TAP has a focus on simplicity and originally came from PERL but has since been ported to other Programming Languages.</p>

            <h6>Mock Libraries:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>TestDouble.js</li>
              <li>Node Nock</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <a href="https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js/" target="_blank">TestDouble</a>
            <p>Testdoublejs is a mocking library like sinon.js but with a smaller api surface.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <a href="https://github.com/node-nock/nock" target="_blank">NOCK</a>
            <p>Nock is an HTTP mocking and expectations library for Node.js</p>
            <p>Nock can be used to test modules that perform HTTP requests in isolation.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest" target="_blank">SuperTest</a>
            <p>Super-agent driven library for testing node.js HTTP servers using a fluent API</p>
            <p>I am using Nock in conjunction with Supertest to both hit my api endpoints and mock out responses for the endpoints.</p>

            <h6>Along with TDD should go the concept of Continuous Integration and Code Coverage IMO.</h6>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>I have a Travis CI Yaml Script</p>
            <p>Additionally I have the code coverage tool called Coveralls hooked into Continuous Integration.</p>

          <section>
            <h6>Additionally Tools Used:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Dotenv</li>
              <li>Eslint</li>
            </ul>

          <section>
            <h6>You should never publish your API Secrets and tokens.</h6>
            <p>I am using a small npm module called dotenv that reads into environment variables into process.env</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Using a linting library like Eslint will help catch errors before they occur</p>
            <p>They also help keep coding styles in sync in larger projects.</p>

            <h6>Libraries for React.js:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>React Router</li>
              <li>Redux</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <a href="http://redux.js.org/" target="_blank">Redux</a>
            <p>Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.</p>
            <p>The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.</p>
            <p>The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.</p>
            <p>To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">React Router</a>
            <p>React Router is a complete routing library for React.</p>
